ALGORITHM: TO FIND AGE

1)According to requirements year and month is given by user.
2) We should scan the birth month and birth year as well as current year and current month.
3) if the month is greater than the current month we should use age=(current_year-birth year)-1, 
and month=(12-birth_month)+current month.and print.
4)if the above condition is false we should do age=current_year-birth year and month+current month-birth month and print it.
