2)Each carriers value as low or high.
3)Compared to 'y' and 'z','x' value is greater means 'x'is high.
4)Like that for same as 'y' and 'z' also.
5)if 'x' is lesss than'y' and'y' is equlity of'z' then it will print'y' and 'z' is bigger.
6)Same thing is happened in each condition and print the largest weight among three.
