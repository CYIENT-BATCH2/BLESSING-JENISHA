Algorithm:PALINDROME OR NOT

1)We are taking the variable as temp,number,rem and rev.
2)First we have to store the number into temp variable.
3) if the remainder is greater than zero only it will enter into the condition.
4)Like ,rev=rev*10+ewm and number is stored in rev.
5)Check it temp is equality of rev only it will print as palindrome.
6) Otherwise it will print as not palindrome.
