ALGORITHM: REVERSE THE DIGIT

1)taken the user input as number.
2)using goto label we are giving the condition.
3)if the remainder  greater than zero only it will go into the loop.
4) using that equation like,rev=rev*10+rem we are finding and storing it.
5) check the number!=0 otherwise it will exit from the condition.
6) print the reverse number.
